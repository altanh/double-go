# TODOs

- Random vs random never terminates: bot keeps filling own eyes and dying.
- If X plays 2 moves in a row, then Y can play 3 in a row, but only if Y plays
  one move, passes, then plays two in a row. This is probably fine? Feels like
  Y should get a "free" move instead. Can be emulated in user interface.
